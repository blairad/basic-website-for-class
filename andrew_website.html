       <h2>Introduction</h2>

          For the last few years i have been working in the hospitality industry after having spent
          the best part of the previous five years either travelling or living and working in Australia
          and New Zealand.
          <br>
          <br>
          I had been thinking of doing this course for a while but have put off applying.  It is a big commitment and
          change from what i have been doing and i worry about being good enough to complete the course and keep up
          with the rest of the class.
